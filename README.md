# DRL_Udacity_Navigation_Project
The environment is a 3D space where an AI navigates and attempts to collect yellow bananas and avoid blue bananas.

The state space is of length 37 and the action space is of length 4. The state space details the visual aspect of the 3D space in 1D-tensor format and the actions are move forward, move backward, turn left, and turn right respectively.

To run the project, pytorch and unityagents packages must be installed. Pytorch's instructions for downloading are here: https://pytorch.org/ and unityagents instructions for downloading are here: pip install unityagents.
